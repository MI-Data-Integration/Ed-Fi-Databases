## Developer Instructions

### Build Instructions

- Requires [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- No special commands to execute - simply call `dotnet build` in the `src`
  directory.

### Unit Testing

Tests can be run through Visual Studio or `dotnet test` in the `src` directory.

### Integration Testing

The `run-integration-tests.ps1` script executes a battery of tests with the
intention of verifying that EdFi.Db.Deploy successfully deploys scripts on both
SQL Server and PostgreSQL. To execute, open Powershell and call:

```powershell
scripts\run-integration-tests.ps1
```

## Contributing

The Ed-Fi Alliance welcomes code contributions from the community. Please read
the [Ed-Fi Contribution
Guidelines](https://techdocs.ed-fi.org/display/ETKB/Code+Contribution+Guidelines)
for detailed information on how to contribute source code.

Looking for an easy way to get started? Search for tickets with label
"up-for-grabs" in [Tracker](https://tracker.ed-fi.org/issues/?filter=14105); these are nice-to-have but low priority tickets that should not
require in-depth knowledge of the code base and architecture.
